title:  "Under Blue Mountain"
---

Under the Blue Mountain, we struggle with anatomy.  Like nineteenth
century naturalists dissecting the corpse of some exquisite bird, we dissect
old magazines to see how they fit together.  What are the parts?  How do we
name them?  What did the people who created these magazines — the editors, the
designers, the printers — call thes zones of significan ink?  What purpose did
they serve?

We are cautious anatomists, well aware of the dangers inherent in
classification, yet our task compels us to demarcate regions of the page for
computation.  What should a machine recognize as text?  Is that a commercial
advertisement or an editorial announcement?  What is the difference?  Why
should we care?

These are foreign languages to us, from countries we don't know: the design
rooms and print shops of nineteenth and early twentieth century Europe; the
garret on Washington Square; the cafés of Zurich and Paris.  They are the
bones of a magazine, the armature that holds the bird aloft.
