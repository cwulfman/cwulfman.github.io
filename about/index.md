I am a senior software architect and researcher in the areas of
digital libraries and digital humanities with extensive strategic
planning and project management experience in research libraries and
higher education. My background combines the study of language and
literature with artificial intelligence and computational linguistics
in the development of open-source XML-encoded archives and software
systems.
